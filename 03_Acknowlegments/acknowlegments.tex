\chapter{Acknowledgements}

First, I want to acknowledge my parents, who always encouraged me to pursue what I wanted to. I also want to mention two beautiful little dogs named Cookie and Cocoa, who were very dependable if you wanted a cuddle to make life better. As for my educational journey, I would like to shout out to Mrs Pannell and Mrs Agnew, who always supported me in high school when others told me I would not be able to study physics at University. Finally, I would like to thank my supervisors, Gavin and Sabrina, who guided my first steps into the field of Astrophysics.
