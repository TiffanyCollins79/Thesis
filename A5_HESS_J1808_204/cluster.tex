\chapter{Spectral Energy Distribution towards Cl*\,1806-20}

% \mbox{HESS\,J1808-204} is a currently unidentified source of VHE gamma-rays towards stellar cluster \mbox{Cl*\,1806-20} and young magnetar \mbox{SGR\,1806-20} \citep{2018A&A...612A...1H}. The stellar cluster contains several energetic stars whose interacting winds accelerate cosmic rays to produce the gamma-ray emission towards \mbox{HESS\,J1808-204} \cite{2018A&A...612A..11H}. Alternatively, the SNR associated with \mbox{SGR\,1806-20} may be the origin of the gamma-ray emission. This section will investigate the origin of \mbox{HESS\,J1808-204} by modelling the multi-wavelength SED using \newsedprod (see \textcolor{red}{reference newsedprod intro})

% % Massive star clusters have been proposed as possible PeVatron candidates (see \textcolor{red}{reference pevatron discussion}), where interacting stellar winds accelerate cosmic rays up to $\PeV$ energies \citep{2019NatAs...3..561A}.

% \section{Cl* 1806-20}

% C1* 1806-20 is estimated to be located between $6-9~\kpc$; the distance used from heron is based on distance to containing magnetar at $8.7~\kpc$ \citep{2008MNRAS.386L..23B}. As well as containing four Wolf Rayet Stars, four OB type stars and the most luminous and massive blue variable star to data, LBV 1806-20; C1* 1806-20 also contains soft gamma repeater SGR 1806-20.
% \par~\par
% SGR 1806-20 is a magnetar, a type of neutron stars with extreme magnetic fields up to $10^{13}-10^{15}~\si{\gauss}$. SGR 1806-20 is most famous for the gamma-ray burst on the 27th December 2004 with luminosity reaching up to $10^{47}~\ergspersecond$  \citep{2005Natur.434.1098H}. To appreciate how large the luminosity is, the measured luminosity of HESS J1808-204 in photon energy range ($0.2-10~\TeV$) is $L_\text{VHE} = 1.6\times 10^{34} (\frac{d}{2})^2 ~\ergspersecond$ \citep{2008MNRAS.386L..23B}. The average x-ray luminosity towards this source is of order $10^{35}~\ergspersecond$. Based on the proper motion from infra-red observations and the that the magnetar originated from the stellar cluster at distance $8.7~\kpc$, the age of SGR 1806-204 is $650\pm 300~\si{yr}$ \citep{2012ApJ...761...76T}.
% \par ~ \par
% Located to the galactic north west of HESS J1808-204 lies SNR G10.0-0.3, a non-thermal radio nebula. It has been noted that SNR G10.0-0.3 has approximately the same intrinsic size as HESS J1808-204, $\ang{0.10}$. If SNR G10.0-0.3 is located at the same distance as HESS J1808-204, $8.7~\kpc$, the size of the radio nebula is $15.1~\kpc$. Assuming that SNR G10.0-0.3 is linked to the $650~\si{yr}$ magnetar, the SNR can be assumed to be the Sedov Taylor Phase (starting at $100~\si{yr}$). The radius of a SNR is this phase is estimated by \cite{2008ARA&A..46...89R}:
% \begin{align}
% 	R_\text{SNR}&=0.31E_{51}^{\frac{1}{5}}\qty(\frac{\mu}{1.4})^{-\frac{1}{5}} n_0^{-\frac{1}{5}}t_\text{yr}^{\frac{2}{5}}\quad\pc
% \end{align}
% where $E_{51}$ is the injected energy normalised to $10^{51}~\ergs$, $\mu$ is the mean mass per particle (assumed to be $1.4$), $n_0$ is the ambient gas density and $t_\text{yr}$ is the age of the SNR. Assuming an ambient gas density of $n_0=1~\centimeterminusthree$, the extent of the SNR linked to magnetar SGR 1806-20 to be $4.1_{-0.9}^{+0.7}~\pc$. This is quite different to the expected extent of $15.1~\kpc$, suggesting that SNR G10.0-0.3 is not linked to the magnetar inside C1* 1806-20. For a SNR aged $650~\si{yr}$ to have extent of $\ang{0.1}$ at distance $8.7~\kpc$, the ambient medium is required to have a density of $0.0015~\centimeterminusthree$. The above calculations assume that the supernova remnant is isolated. If SNR G10.0-0.3 is connected to C1* 1806-20 then it is possible that the combined stellar winds of surrounding massive stars may affect the evolution of the supernova remnant linked to SGR 1806-20.
% \par~\par
% It has been noted that the surrounding non-thermal radio nebula G10.0-0.3 peaks around luminous blue variable LBV 1806-20. With HESS J1806-204 similar extent and orientation to the nebula, it suggests a more likely connection to the luminous blue variable rather than the magnetar \colorbox{red}{Reference Molecular Paper here}
% \par~\par.
% Towards this cluster also lies two Fermi sources; 3FGL J1809.2-2016c and Fermi J1808.2-2029. 3FGL J1809.2-2016c and Fermi J1808.2-2029 are located towards the same region in the sky but the former is a point source object while Fermi J1808.2-209 is a circular extended source \citep{2016ApJ...827...41Y}.  Fermi J1808.2-2029 is believed to be located $4.7~kpc$ away with angular separation from HESS J1808-204 to be $\ang{0.35}$. In study by \cite{2016ApJ...827...41Y} the source of emission from fermi J1808.2-2019 is either the hadronic interaction between the SNR and nearby molecular clouds and (or a combination of) leptonic interactions with stellar winds from the cluster.

% Stars that are densely packed, as in stellar clusters, tend to blow out a bubble in the interstellar medium. Towards HESS J1808-204 nine components of molecular clouds has been noted by \cite{2004A&A...419..191C} in $\ce{^{12}CO(1-0)}$ and $\ce{^{13}CO(1-0)}$ gas data. A summary of these clouds as found by \colorbox{red}{Reference Molecular Paper here} is shown in table \ref{tab:cluster_CO_density}. Spatial correlation  between MC 73 and HESS J1808-20 was noted. This may indicate a connection between the gamma-ray emission observed from this region and this molecular cloud. It has been suggested by other studies that MC -16 is related to C1* 1806-20.
% \par~\par
% The parameters of cloud MC 73 will be considered while modelling the spectral energy distribution towards HESS J1808-204. For this reason densities of $14~\centimeterminusthree$ and $144~\centimeterminusthree$ (corresponding to the density of $\ce{^{13}CO(1-0)}$ and total $\ce{CO(1-0)}$ respectively) will be considered. The magnetic field can be obtained through Crutchers Relationship \citep{Crutcher_1999} (see Eq.~\ref{eq:ISM_crutchers}).

% \section{Single Zone Modelling towards HESS J1808-204}


% This work considers two possible scenarios to explain the gamma-ray emission towards HESS J1808-204. The first scenario is the continuous particle injection by the combined stellar winds from C1* 1806-20. The alternative is the sudden release of cosmic rays from the supernova remnant that occurred due to the creation of SGR 1806-20. HESS j1808-20 spectral energy distribution follows a simple power low ($\dv{N}{E}\propto E^{-\Gamma}$) with index $\Gamma=2.3\pm 0.2_\text{stat}\pm 0.3_\text{sys}$ and photon flux normalisation $2.9 \times 10^{-13}~\si{ph\per\centi\meter\squared\per\second\per\tera\electronvolt}$ \citep{2018A&A...612A..11H}.

% \subsection{Spectral Energy Distribution}

% The spectral energy distribution of objects towards HESS J1808-20 is shown in figure \ref{hess_j1808_20_spectra}. It is interesting to note that data measured by Fermi for 3DFGL J1809.20-2016c appears to follow the HESS data of HESS J1808-20. This may indicate that these two sources are connected and will be examined in this research. HESS  J1808-20 spectral energy distribution follows a simple power low ($\dv{N}{E}\propto E^{-\Gamma}$) with index $\Gamma=2.3\pm 0.2_\text{stat}\pm 0.3_\text{sys}$ and photon flux normalisation $2.9 \times 10^{-13}~\si{ph\per\centi\meter\squared\per\second\per\tera\electronvolt}$ \citep{2018A&A...612A..11H}.

% \end{figure}

% The particles constantly being injected into the surrounding medium around HESS J1808-20 allows gamma-rays to be emitted. Massive stars exist for over $1\times 10^6~\si{yr}$; the presence of the magnetar suggests that one of these old stars went supernova. Assuming that the predecessor of the magnetar is a O-type, the same type as stars contained within the cluster, this suggests the age of the system to be within range $0.1-10$ million years. Research into this system suggests that the age of C1* 1806-20 is between $3-4.5$ million years \citep{2005ApJ...622L..49F}.
% \par~\par
% The predicted spectral energy distribution of an old and continuous source can be shown in figure \ref{fig:continuous_cluster_SEDS}. High energy particles (both protons and electrons) are continuously injected into a molecular could with density $14~\centimeterminusthree$. The spectra of the high energy particles is assumed to be an exponential cutoff power law with $\dv{N}{E}\propto E^{-\Gamma}\exp(E/E_c)$. It has been estimated that stellar wind luminosity of a single massive can be as high as $10^{36}-10^{39}~\ergspersecond$ \citep{2018JKAS...51...37S}. The required energy budgets of both hadronic and leptonic scenarios, of order $10^{35}~\ergspersecond$, is well underneath this limit. Therefore an old and continuous source, such as the combined stellar winds of stellar cluster C1* 1806-20, as the origin of high energy gamma rays from HESS J1808-20 cannot be rejected.
% \par~\par
% It is interesting to note that for a purely leptonic scenario, the radio emission from G10.0-0.3 can be replicated. But for both a hadronic and leptonic case, the emission of Fermi source 3FGL J1809.2-2016.c can not be simultaneously predicted with the \HESS data.

% \subsection{Young and Impulsive Source}

The total SED is shown in the transparent grey line.}
% 	\label{fig:impulsive_cluster_SEDS}
% \end{figure}

% The presence of a magnetar inside C1* 1806-20 indicated that sometime in the past (approximately $650~\si{yr}$), a supernova occurred. This supernova remnant will impulsively release $10^{50}~\ergs$ of cosmic rays (approximately $10^{48}~\ergs$ partitioned to leptons) into the surrounding medium. The cosmic rays are then allowed to interact with the surrounding medium forming gamma-rays.
% \par~\par
% The results of the spectral energy distribution modelling can be seen in figure \ref*{fig:impulsive_cluster_SEDS}. Similarly to an old and continuous source, particles are injected into the interstellar medium with an exponential cutoff power-law ($\dv{N}{E}\propto E^{-\Gamma}\exp{E/E_c}$). $3.0\times 10^{48}~\ergs$ of cosmic rays is required to reproduce the spectra as seen by \HESS towards HESS J1808-20. This is well underneath the $10^{50}~\ergs$ upper limit and allows for a fraction of release cosmic rays to escape. On the other hand $1.20\times 10^{48}~\ergs$ of electrons is required to reproduce the spectra of HESS J1808-20. This is just within the upper limit of $10^{48}$. The radio emission of G10.0-0.3 cannot be replication with a young but impulsive source. For both cases, the observed Fermi emission towards 3FGL J1809.2-2016c cannot be simultaneous predicted with the \HESS data.

% \subsection{Combination}

% The more probably case for HESS J1808-20 is a combination of the SNR linked to the SGR 1806-20 and the combined stellar winds. This research did not consider the interaction between the SNR and combined stellar winds; though other studies suggest that supernova within stellar clusters allow cosmic rays to be accelerated up to $\PeV$ energies \citep{2018AdSpR..62.2764B}. Stellar Clusters are considered to be a possible candidate for high energy particle acceleration.
