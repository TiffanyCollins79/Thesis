\chapter{Abstract}
Pulsars are dense, rapidly spinning remnants of massive stars. Charged particles are stripped off the surface of the pulsar by extreme magnetic fields and are accelerated beyond $\TeV$ energies, forming the powerful winds known as pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe). These particles, known as cosmic rays, escape into the interstellar medium (ISM) and interact with soft photon fields to produce gamma rays or with magnetic fields to produce radio to X-ray emission. One of the major mysteries in modern-day astrophysics is how protons and electrons propagate within PWN environments.

\mbox{HESS\,J1825-137} is a bright, extended $\TeV$ PWN, making it an ideal laboratory to study cosmic-ray transport in PWN. Both the HAWC and LHAASO observatories have observed gamma-ray emission from \mbox{HESS\,J1825-137} greater than $50~\TeV$, indicative of a PeVatron; a source capable of accelerating electrons up to energies greater than $10^{15}~\eV$. This thesis focuses on understanding the origin of the X-ray to gamma-ray emission towards \mbox{HESS\,J1825-137}.

\textit{Fermi}-LAT observations revealed extended $\GeV$ emission to the Galactic south of \mbox{HESS\,J1825-137}. The first portion of this thesis investigated whether this $\GeV$ emission originated from the PWN associated with \mbox{HESS\,J1825-137}, its progenitor supernova remnant (SNR) or a source linked to the nearby X-ray binary \mbox{LS\,5039}. ISM gas analysis was first conducted towards this region in order to constrain the multi-wavelength emission. The analysis highlighted a dense cloud of CO(1-0) gas lying towards the $\GeV$ region at the same distance as \mbox{LS\,5039} that is coincident with a H$\alpha$ SNR rim associated with \mbox{HESS\,J1825-137}. The results of the gas analysis was combined with spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling to show that neither a source associated with \mbox{HESS\,J1825-137} or \mbox{LS\,5039} is likely to be the sole origin of high-energy protons or electrons towards the $\GeV$ region. A combination of both sources could result in the gamma-ray emission. This study emphasised the complexity of the region towards \mbox{HESS\,J1825-137}.

The second part of this thesis investigated the multi-wavelength SED and gamma-ray morphology towards \mbox{HESS\,J1825-137} to disentangle the transport mechanisms of electrons from the pulsar. Electrons escaping the PWN propagate diffusively (where particles scatter off turbulence, resulting in 'random-walk') and/or via advection (the bulk motion of particles). The region towards \mbox{HESS\,J1825-137} was divided into a 3D grid of spatially-dependent number density and magnetic field. The transport of electrons from the pulsar wind nebula was then modelled using a numerical solution of the transport equation to reproduce the multi-wavelength SED and gamma-ray morphology seen towards \mbox{HESS\,J1825-137}. A diffusive model with an advective velocity of $0.002c$ ($c$ is the speed of light) towards lower Galactic longitudes van broadly explain the observations. Additionally, a turbulent region of gas with a magnetic field between $20-60~\si{\micro G}$ is required to prevent significant gamma-ray contamination towards the nearby northern $\TeV$ source, \mbox{HESS\,J1826-136}.

The modelling conducted in this thesis is not constrained to \mbox{HESS\,J1825-137} and can be applied to other $\TeV$ PWN or other gamma-ray sources to develop understanding of how cosmic-ray sources evolve in their respective environments.
